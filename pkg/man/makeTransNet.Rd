\arguments{
\item{treedata}{Input tree data.}

\item{metadata}{Corresponding metadata.}

\item{centralityMetric}{Number identifying a centrality metric.
- 0 to simply calculate all metrics
- 1 for indegree
- 2 for outdegree
- 3 for betweenness
- 4 for closeness
- 5 for degree
- 6 for Source Hub Ratio}

\item{threshold}{Filter out pairs of changes between same states and also with state probabilities below a this threshold.
(Default: 0.9)}

\item{threshold2}{For Bayesian trees, filter out pairs of changes between same states and also with posterior probabilities below a this threshold.
(Default: 0.9)}

\item{bootstrapValue}{For neighbor-joining trees, the number of iterations to perform in the bootstrap analysis.
(Default: Null)}

\item{treeType}{The type of tree being used. Choice from "parsimonious", "bayesian", or "nj" for neighbor-joining.
(Default: "parsimonious")}

\item{rootSelection}{For neighbor-joining trees, the accession name of the terminal to use as the tree's root.}

\item{columnselection}{Which of the metadata columns by which to summarize.}
