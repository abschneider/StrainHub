#'        the phylogenetic tree that was read in by the read.tree() function;
#'      $Nnode - a numeric vector of length one whose value is the number of nodes on the 
#'        inner branches of the tree;
#'      $tip.label - a character vector whose elements are the character string that
#'        identifies a leaf node on the phylogenetic tree;
#' @note 
#'  The asr_max_parsimony() function requires a numeric vector that lists the character states of the leaf nodes in sequence as one of its parameter arguments. The following for loop
#'   walks through the character vector $tip.label in the rootedTree list, starting at the 
#'   index [1], and stores the value of $tip.label[i] in the character vector accession.
#'   This character string is then passed into the find function of the hashmap and its
#'   character state is returned. Thus when the loop is complete, it has populated 
#'   the metadataStates numeric vector with the character states associated with the 
#'   leaf nodes in the order that they appeal in $tip.label;
#'  Get character state for each node that isn't a leaf node (i.e. all the inner nodes)
#'  asr_max_parsimony accepts 3 parameters:
#'     - the list object returned by the read.tree() function
#'     - the character states of the leaf nodes listed in the $tip.label character vector found in the list object
#'     - the number of possible character states of the trait
#' 
#' asr_max_parsimony returns a list object with the following components:
#'
#'   $ancestral_likelihoods - a numeric matrix object with nrows = the number of inner nodes 
#'     in the phylogenetic tree, and ncolumns = to the number of possible character states
#'     of the character trait being studied. The value at $ancestral_likelihoods[n,m] is 
#'     the probability of interior node n being character state m
#'   $success - a logical vector of length one that says whether the process was a success or not
